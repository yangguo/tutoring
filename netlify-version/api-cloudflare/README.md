# Cloudflare Worker API for Tutoring

This folder contains the Cloudflare Worker backend for the tutoring app. It currently covers the core auth, books, dashboard, chat, and achievements routes used by the frontend; some administrative/upload endpoints from the Express API are still pending.

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Create a `.dev.vars` file for Wrangler (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).
3. Start the local dev server (Miniflare):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The Worker runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8787`. Point the frontend `VITE_API_URL` to this origin while testing.

## Deployment

1. Authenticate Wrangler (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   wrangler login
   ```
2. Deploy the Worker:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
   Alternatively, integrate this command into a Cloudflare Pages build to deploy automatically from Git.

## Environment Variables

Set secrets via `.dev.vars` (local) and Wrangler/Cloudflare dashboard (production). Required bindings:

- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_KEY` (service role key)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (defaults to `https://api.openai.com/v1` if omitted)
- `OPENAI_MODEL` (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`)
- `JWT_SECRET`

Example `.dev.vars`:

```
SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_KEY=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
JWT_SECRET=...
```

## Available Routes

- `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/register`, `GET /api/auth/me`, `POST /api/auth/logout`
- `GET /api/books`, `GET /api/books/:id`
- `POST /api/upload` *(stub â€” extend to implement storage like the Express API)*
- `GET /api/dashboard/*` (students, lessons, progress, analytics)
- `POST /api/chat/lesson`, `POST /api/chat/speaking-practice`
- `GET /api/achievements`

### Known limitations

- Upload endpoints (`POST /api/upload/book`, `POST /api/upload/book/:bookId/pages`) are not yet ported; `POST /api/upload` currently returns a stub response.
- Achievements detail routes (`/api/achievements/user/:id`, `/achievements/leaderboard`, etc.) are not implemented.
- Additional admin/analytics endpoints from Express remain pending.

When adding functionality, update both the Express app and the Worker (or document the divergence) so behaviour stays aligned.

Keep Worker routes in sync with the Express API so the frontend can switch between deployments without behavioural changes.
